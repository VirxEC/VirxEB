jump_shot sometimes hits the ball much harder
removed the atba routine (just use short_shot)
better short_shot
better braking in the retreat routine
better offensive rotations
wall recoveries
better adjustment system for jump_shot and double_jump
on-the-fly shot vector calculations
double_jump sometimes hits the ball much harder
jump_shot has more accurate jumps
fixed braking in the goto routine
errors are now printed to a traceback file(s)
pathfinding will do flips when they need to cover a large distance
removed dribbles from jump_shot
added new routine 'ground_shot'
defaultThrottle can now handle handbrake with defaultPD's target_angles and the local target
new util `defaultDrive` - it combines defaultPD and defaultThrottle, with the ability to drive backwards
moved the prediction thread to the main thread
more aggressive 1's play
improved corner kickoff
if VirxEB is already flying, then the minimum aerial height is now 150
steering now acts like in-air yawing when the handbrake is active
changed of finding any shot so now it's an anti-shot unless the bot is in the goal
adjustment system now considers the needed jumping time
fixed bug with double_jump's update method
removed the utils backsolve, post_correction and shot_valid
added util perimeter_of_ellipse
added new offensive shots that are on the goal walls
new util cap_in_field
the start slice (when searching for shots) is now determined by the bot's minimum time to ball value
backwards double jump shots
removed the block_ground_shot routine
new Vector class that's a wrapper for numpy
new method in the Vector class - scale
removed methods tuple and list from the Vector class
new util methods dodge_impulse, turn radius, curvature, and is_inside_turn_radius
removed int method from the Vector class in favor of doing round(Vector)
better boost management
better wave dashes
new back offset kickoffs
new defensive kickoffs
partial heatseaker support
new logic for when to employ flips / wave dashes
better shadowing logic
better retreat logic
improved the strategy
shot finding optimizations
more measures to prevent the bot from traveling on the walls
double_jump and Aerial now target the offset target and not shot_vector
adjusted the PD controller
properly adjusted Matrix3's left property to the now correctly named 'right'
new util 'throttle_acceleration'
better boost/throttle decision making in defaultThrottle
new, better back kickoff
