Unlimited boost is now understood
Adjustments for low gravity situations
New enemy time to ball prediction (runs @ 10hz)
The bot drives at 2300uus until it's within 2560uus of the ball (when shooting)
Car turning/driving simulation (runs @ 30hz)
Less overcommits when shadowing
Fixed pathfinding when inside the net
Fixed finding aerials via find_shot and find_any_shot
Much better 1's play
Fix sending 2 bots on the back left & back right kickoffs
Removed the shot_valid method on everything except block_ground_shot
Shots now update their ball information from the ball prediction struct
Better corner kickoffs
Added Rumble 'support'
More accurate invalid shot tests
Neutral/Offense is now determined by the minimum time to ball, instead of the distance
New not-fast aerials that can hit the ball harder
Double jumps are much more accurate
Jump shots are also much more accurate
Jump shots won't jump, if it's appropriate
block_ground_shot will just get to the required destination asap
face_target now has a non-air mode for low & high gravity situations
New boost_down routine
block_ground_shot should flip more often
Offense = Neutral = ball > boost
Grabbing boost will now not stop bc of distance to the target
More accurate shot validation functions (order of execution mumble mumble...)
