block_ground_shot will now flip towards the ball
Smarter centers on offense
A majority of the math required to find a shot is now done in C
If VirxEB is already shooting, then the shot tools will only consider up to the shot time
More aggressive defensive play
Removed the retreat loop where it gets pushed to the stack and gets popped right away, and the bot does nothing
VirxEB's general recovery now faces towards the ball
New methods that execute only when VirxEB is in the air and not shooting
Optimized finding a better shot when already shooting
Optimized finding a shot with a cap in the seconds
Added speed corner kickoffs
Searches a lot more slices from the ball prediction
Fixed the defender coming out of the net on an opponent's break away
More pathfinding improvements
Smarter backchecks
Retreat works in 2's/1's
More consistant capping of shot times
Fine tuned shot values (auto calculated on start)
Removed minimum boost requirement (was 24) on aerials
Fixed errors caused by having no teammates
In 2's, if VirxEB is either up down by 2, he will start to play more defensive
More agressive in 1's (sometimes)
More passive in 1's (sometimes)

Linked ball_recovery to recovery
VirxEB can now recover on the ceiling
If VirxEB lands on the ceiling somehow, he can do a ceiling shot
